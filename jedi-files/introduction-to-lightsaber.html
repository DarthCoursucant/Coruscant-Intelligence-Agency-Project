                        <p>As younglings, your life is contained within the Temple. Until you're selected as a Padawan, your trips outside the Jedi Temple will be rare and short. So to prepare for that day, you'll need to study up. Beware that the Jedi Archives don't tell you the whole story.</p>
                        <p>The good news is, you're already at the center of it all. Coruscant is the capital of the Republic and the prime planet of the Core Worlds, located just north of the unwelcoming Deep Core.</p>
                        <p>The next two regions, the Colonies and the Inner Rim, mark the outermost limits of what most citizens consider civilization. Theres a lot more to see in the galaxy, but exploring it may mean stepping outside your comfort zone.</p>

                        <p>Beyond the Inner Rim is the Expansion Region-home to factory worlds that are mostly empty and decaying. Keep going and you'll pass the agricultural Mid Rim on your way to the lawlessness of the Outer Rim Territories. It's here that you'll find some of the galaxy's worst criminals, and it's here that a skilled Jedi can make a difference.</p>
                        <p>All this territory can be quickly traversed on the Hydian Way, the Corellian Run, or the Perlemian Trade Route. Most of you won't get your own starfighter, but there's no shame in booking passage aboard a star liner—the Jedi are public servants, after all.</p>

                        <p>There are many dangers in these sectors, but you must not fear them.</p>
                        <p>As you grow, some of you may find yourselves assigned to a satellite training academy.</p>
                        <p>Coruscant's Temple isn't the only facility for Jedi students, and some Initiates and Padawans can learn more under a customized curriculum.</p>

                        <p>Even Masters like myself visit these sites from time to time. It's nice to have a friendly port to duck , into when you re on the run from i Zygerrian pirates.</p>
                        <p>The training academies on Kamparas, Telos, and Obroaskai specialize in data collection and analysis for you budding geniuses. The Tython and Alpheridies academies promise deeper study of the Force for hopeful mystics. The academies on Rhinnal and H'ratth may be homes for the healers among you. And don't forget the Socorro academy for Jedi Guardians—an outpost of order in a decadent and lawless world. That ones my favorite.</p>
