                        <p>The final branch of the Jedi Service Corps is the most far-flung. The Exploration Corps considers the whole galaxy its territory, and its members are rarely found in the Jedi Temple (save for the ranking Masters, who report to the Reassignment Council). Instead, small ExplorCorps outposts can be found in practically every Republic Ordinance or Regional Depots (ORD), some of them dating back 10,000 years.</p>
                        <p>These refueling and resupply outposts are used for staging expeditions into nearby space. The mission of the ExplorCorps is to uncover new planets, artifacts, species, creatures, and hyper routes, and to assist any innocents they may find in the course of their adventures.</p>

                        <p>At each ORD base, the ExplorCorps team operates a few long-range scout ships, each light on armament but heavy on sensors and consumables. Members of the ExplorCorps are responsible for making first contact with any species that might join the Republic.</p>
                        <p>It is a huge honor to represent the face of the galactic coalition. Not every species is friendly at first, so the ExplorCorps sees the most combat of any of the Jedi Service Corps. It also has the highest proportion of Knights and Masters serving in its ranks. Some Masters specialize in the art of Force navigation, a technique that uses outward-directed meditation to smooth the tangles of hyperspace and penetrate territories believed to be off-limits. </p>

                        <p>The ExplorCorps is slowly chipping away at the expanse of the Unknown Regions, one system at a time. In addition to managing the ORD bases, the ExplorCorps operates a number of praxeum ships. Initiates who move on to a career in the ExplorCorps will sooner or later find themselves aboard one of these mobile training academies, where they can continue their education while helping out with long-term space missions.</p>
                        <p>The Explor Corps is affiliated with both the Republic Survey Corps and the Intergalactic Zoological Society. The Academy of Jedi Archaeology is also affiliated with the ExplorCorps, whose members uncover relics and inscriptions that are then turned over to the Educational Corps for translation.</p>
