                        <p>When you reach the end of your years as Jedi Initiates, you will no longer be younglings, and can no longer remain in the Temple. Without growth, there is death. All of you must pass from Initiate into a new level of service. To reach this new level, you must complete the Initiate Trials. You should be well prepared for them at this stage</p>
                        <p><b>You must demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the Jedi Code. You must also demonstrate self-discipline through meditation and lightsaber combat. You must prove that the Force flows through you and that you are not a rock stubbornly blocking its current.</b></p>

                        <p>All these things are to be expected of one who has completed the training of a Jedi Initiate, but not all of you will pass through to the same place.</p>
                        <p>Some of you will graduate from Initiate to Padawan. This will see you apprenticed to a Jedi Knight or Master, and is a necessary step in becoming a Knight or Master yourself. But competency at the Initiate Trials is not enough to earn a Padawan apprenticeship. You must forge a bond with a Knight or Master, and some of you will discover that the Force does not wish you to follow such a path. Meditate on it now, so you will be prepared should such a moment come to pass.</p>

If you are not tak-gen on as an apprenticed Padawan, a position in the Agricultural Corps or the Educational Corps will allow you to continue to follow the principles you have sworn to up hold and serve the Republic as you have vowed.</p>
                        <p>Some of you may not follow either path. Regretfully, the Council may decide the path of the Jedi is not for you. If you arrive at this decision yourself, then it is the Force speak-ing to you, and you are not meant to follow the Jedi Path. Should this be your destiny, remember your train-ing as you build a new life, and seek out opportunities to be of benefit to yourself and others.</p>
