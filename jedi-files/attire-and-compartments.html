                        <p>Younglings who have grown up within the Temple hardly need guide on what to wear. You've been wearing a uniform since you could stand.</p>
                        <p>The dress of a Jedi Initiate is essentially that of a Jedi Padawan, Knight, or Master. Tan or gray tunic, boots, belt— everything but the robe. The attire is not exactly the same as that worn by your elders, but it will identify you as a Jedi.</p>
                        <p>When you finally step outside these walls to walk the galaxy, the same clothes you consider ordinary will be a symbol. People will approach you looking for wisdom. Others will beg you to fight their enemies. And others will attack you.</p>

                        <p>Your uniform defines you. Wear it well and wear it with pride. When you sleep, fold it and place it at the foot of your mat. When you sweat through it after lightsaber train-ing, wash it. When your boots are scuffed, polish them. Don't ask the droid to do it; polish them yourself.</p>
                        <p>A dirty or wrinkled uniform will get you a reprimand from your instructors, but if that's your only reason for taking care of one of your sole possessions, you don't appreciate what you have here in the Temple.</p>

                        <p>For those of you who are crystal-line, or gas-based— or have a body structure that discourages standard clothing—you wear a sash, at the very least. Take care of it.</p>
                        <p>I'm a recruiter. I've brought hundreds of Force-sensitives to the Temple. Some of these younglings had already begun their first lives and were accustomed to soft fabrics, riotous colors, and endless choices—all the indulgences of the outsiders who value self over service. For these younglings, it can be hard to make the transition.</p>
                        <p>Always remember that being a Jedi also means looking the part. Your attire is an outward sign of your commitment, and a constant reminder of your lifelong calling.</p>
