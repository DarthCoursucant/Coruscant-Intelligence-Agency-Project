                        <p>Be thankful you can sense the Living Force, young Initiates. Outside the Jedi Temple you will discover an infinite variety of life-forms that contribute to the universal energy field. </p>
                        <p>All of them are worthy of a Jedi's protection. Xenobiology is a fascinating specialization!</p>
                        <p>Animals are what most call living creatures not outwardly capable of speech or mathematics. As a Jedi, you will sense that this distinction isn't so simple. Most beasts do speak, if only among their own kind, and communicating in their tongue is a talent you can master.</p>

                        <p>What follows is a sampling of the types of creatures you might en-counter, but more information is always available in the Archives.</p>
                        <p>Creatures can be found to exist in nearly any environment—if there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that the Force always finds a way. Amid the towering ice crystals of Mygeeto, you'll find pertorqus candus — Mygeetan white worms-coiled in caves where their skin absorbs geothermal heat from the planet's core and converts it to food energy.</p>
                        <p>The jungle world of Troiken hosts the indictidile, a spiked insect that curls into a ball and impales its prey by rolling wildly through the undergrowth.</p>

                        <p>As a Padawan, I once conducted a month-long study of the Joda-kan needler crab, measuring its dart-firing accuracy and vastly improving the centuries-old data that was gathering dust in the Jedi Archives. For an illuminating example of pan-species cooperation, don't miss the moon of Alchenaut, where palm-sized furballs that I named ocerrys act as a predator warning system for thousands of other herbivores.</p>
                        <p>Even deep space harbors life-you'll never forget your first glimpse of an exogorth or a giant neebray manta.</p>

                        <p>All these creatures are bound together by one thing— the Force. (If this was not your first thought, you might be in the wrong Temple.) Even life-forms without midi-chlorians and cellular structures, such as the fractal urchins of Pro-togeyser, can touch its energy.</p>
                        <p>Other creatures can do even more remarkable things, such as projecting bubbles that push the Force away, but the Council has quarantined such worlds, and full instruction on these creatures will come when you are older.</p>
