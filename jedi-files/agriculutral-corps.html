                        <p>Accordingly, we are affiliated with the Republic Agricultural Administration, but we're Jedi, not bureaucrats. (Sometimes you will have to remind your peers o that fact.)</p>
                        <p>The principle behind the Agri-Corps is that the Living Force exists in all things and responds to your will.</p>
                        <p>Our enemies aren’t exactly Sith Lords, but they're the foes of life just the same. </p>

                        <p>The AgriCorps is headed by a council of Jedi Masters with a special affinity for this line of work—lots of Ho'Din and Ithorians fill our ranks.</p>
                        <p>Jedi Initiates sometimes serve brief rotations within the Corps as part of their instruction in the Living Force.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the AgriCorps consists of us lifers. Most of our work is based on Salliche or on the string of Core Worlds making up the Salliche Ag Circuit. </p>
