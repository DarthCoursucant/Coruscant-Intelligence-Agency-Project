                        <p>It is rare for Padawans to construct nonstandard lightsabers during their visionary experiences on Ilum. Often, a variant design doesn't emerge until much later, after years of experience spent analyzing ones own fighting style and evaluating deficiencies caused by that first effort.</p>
                        <p><b>The curved-hilt lightsaber is perhaps the least radical of all variants. Its extended handle accommodates a slight bend seldom exceeding thirty degrees. This style is common among practitioners of Form II lightsaber combat, who prefer its balanced weight and precise handling for saber-to-saber dueling.</b></p>

                        <p><b>The shoto is a short saber with a blade extending perhaps a half-meter. The shoto is often wielded in a Jedi's off hand as a second blade. The guard shoto is carried by means of a perpendicular handle, allowing for spins that put an opponent off balance but put oneself at risk. I do not condon the use of the guard shoto.</b></p>
                        <p><b>The lightclub is a giant-sized saber, with a massive handle and a thick blade. Light-clubs are often built by Houks or other Jedi of unusually large size.</b></p>

                        <p><b>A familiar image from the last Sith War, the dual-bladed lightsaber is known as a Sith weapon, but there is nothing inherently wicked in its design. Using one takes years of study, and few Jedi-besides myself-can instruct you.</b></p>

Instead of having a rigid blade, the lightwhip's energy tendril is flexible and can be wielded to entangle or cut.
