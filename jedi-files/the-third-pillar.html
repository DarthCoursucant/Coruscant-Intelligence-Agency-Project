                        <p>Many of you Initiates are all too eager to rush into this field of knowledge, for this is where you get to swing a lightsaber. But it is called the Third Pillar for a reason. Until you have demonstrated your connection to the Force and your willingness to study and learn, you will never be admitted into my class.</p>
                        <p>For those who have passed that test, you will do well to remember that this pillar is Self-Discipline, not Combat. It is impossible to wield a lightsaber without first mastering the action of your physical self.</p>
                        <p>This is why we give Initiates training sabers. By the time you build a real blade as a Padawan, you should have enough skill not to cut off your own arm.</p>

                        <p>Meditation is the key to aligning your mind and body with the spirit and will of the Force. As Initiates you should be meditating five times a day. That's not enough. Whenever you have a moment to yourself, even if you're standing outside a training chamber waiting for a session to begin, center yourself as you have been taught. The Force will rejuvenate your body and sharpen your mind, even in brief moments.</p>
                        <p>You can practice deeper states during your daily sessions. Try to achieve Empty Meditation, which purges your negative emotions and lets you step back from attachment. </p>
