                        <p>If you young students know anything, you know this: The Force is an energy field created by all living things. Even the pallie vendor on the megablock corner can recite that. It's a droid's definition!</p>
                        <p>We Jedi are blessed with the gift of swimming in the Force in our every moment-breathing it, tasting it, riding its currents to our unique destinies. For the Jedi, the universe is never cold and directionless. The Force gives us purpose, and compels us to share our gifts with others.</p>

                        <p>Master Bowspritz will teach you of the midi-chlorians in our cells that channel the Forces energy. I urge you not to think too much on this necessary biological symbiosis but to instead cast your focus wider. After all, we do not drink the bowl but the soup contained within it.</p>
                        <p>The Force is bigger than all of us, but expresses itself in two aspects.</p>
                        <p>The Living Force is raw and close at hand. It is the life energy tingling around you when you pass among plants and animals in a walk through a jungle. When beings die, you sense it through the Living Force.</p>

                        <p>When many die at once, the loss of their energy may shock you, even knock you out. All of your tangible Force abilities— such as running, jumping, heightened senses, moving objects, or soothing the emotions of others— are techniques by which we become agents of the Living Force.</p>
                        <p>The Unifying Force is a vast cosmic power. You may not sense it yet, but with patience and insight you will. The Unifying Force is the stars and galaxies, the rippling surface of space and time. It is this voice that whispers of your destiny, and make no mistake—the Force does have a will. To commune with the Unifying Force is to temporarily leave your body behind, allowing you to walk in the past or see the future. Some of the ancients believe it is possible to even transcend death.</p>
