                        <p>This volume is an instructional guide to your life in the Jed Temple and the service that awaits you when you leave. Heed the wisdom in these pages, but most importantly, pay attention to your teachers! Force instruction is held during morning sessions; history and politics at midday; and physical training in the afternoon. In addition, students must engage in five mandatory meditation sessions each day.</p>

                        <p>You do not face your challenges alone. All Jedi Initiates are assigned a family that will surround you from the moment the sunstone wakes you to the moment you drift to sleep on your mat. For most of you, your can was selected before you reached the age of three or reached your species equivalent in maturity. The Jedi fosterers who watched over you in infancy foresaw where you would belong.</p>
