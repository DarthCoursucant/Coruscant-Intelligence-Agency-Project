                        <p>As an Initiate you have learned much in the ways of the jedi, but words of experience remain a mystery to you. As you progress from Initiate to Padawan, communal instruction from the Templés teachers is replaced by one-on-one guidance from a Master. Not every Initiate will become a Padawan, but those who do will follow the call of the Force into a new level of service.</p>
                        <p>When you reach the appropriate age (for most humanoids, between approximately twelve to fourteen standard years) and have passed the Initiate Trials, you are eligible to be selected by a Jedi Knight or Master to become an apprentice.</p>

                        <p>One way in which you can attract the attention of a potential Master is through the Apprentice Tournament. Each year, the Temple holds a lightsaber contest for Padawans, which has at times included a free-for-all round or contests held underwater or in a zero-g chamber.</p>
                        <p>Although the tournament winner will undoubtedly receive an apprenticeship, the tournament's true purpose is to demonstrate your individual style so that a visiting Master might assess your abilities and potential to be a good fit as his or her Padawan.</p>
                        <p>For Initiates who aren't gifted in combat, the Apprentice Tournament may not be the best validation of your skills. </p>

                        <p>Jedi Consulars who are looking for new Padawans often forego the tournament in favor of asking the Temple staff to point out promising scholars. Thus, if you are hoping for a good recommendation, it is best to keep this in mind when dealing with your instructors.</p>
                        <p>The Council is generally not involved in the pairing of a Master and a Padawan. The Force will act as a guide, expressing itself through this bond, and rarely needs outside help. However, Jedi Seers have at times perceived destinies that require a particular arrangement of players. In these decisions, the will of the Force— and by extension, the will of the Council— must be honored. The Council's word is final.</p>
