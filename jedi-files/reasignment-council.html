                        <p>Everybody thinks they know what a fedi is- that we all serve in the Army of Light and fight the Sith Lords, or that were all lightsaber battle masters and star fighter aces. It just isn't so. Jedi can serve the Republic in other ways, too. The Jedi Service Corps is an honorable alternative for any graduating Initiate, and he or she should be proud to serve among its ranks.</p>
                        <p>When most Initiates hit early adolescence, they seek to pair up with Masters to begin their Padawan apprenticeships. If you are not selected, then what? You can try again the following season, but eventually the Temple instructors may tell you that you’ve run out of chances— and then the Reassignment Council steps in.</p>

                        <p>The Jedi Service Corps consists of four branches: the Agricultural Corps, the Medical Corps, the Educational Corps, and the Exploration Corps. The Reassignment Council, which assigns candidates to one of these four branches, manages the careers of these Jedi once they have been placed.</p>
                        <p>Not every member of the Jedi Service Corps failed to become a Padawan. Many Knights, Masters, and Padawans chose to work with the Corps because of their special talents— enjoying the best of both worlds, you might say. </p>
