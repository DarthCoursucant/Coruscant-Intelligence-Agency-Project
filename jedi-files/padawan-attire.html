                        <p>Much of the Jedi success hinges precariously on the publics perception of the Order. Please don't make my job as a recruiter harder by looking sloppy and slothful.</p>
                        <p>Your braid is the most significant sign of your status as a new Padawan. For species with hair or fur, your tightly wound braid is grown behind the left or right ear while the rest of your hair is kept closely trimmed. It may also be adorned with beads or weavings. This braid marks you as a Jedi Padawan. It will be removed when you pass to Knighthood.</p>

                        <p>Species that don't grow hair may instead wear a woven braid of canvas or cloth around the wrist, neck, ear, or horn. Other alternatives have emerged over the centuries: Iktotchi Padawans can wear a metal circlet over the tip of their cranial horn. Sluissi Padawans can bisect their left cheek with a facial tattoo.</p>
                        <p>Swokes Swokes Padawans can implant a medallion into the flesh beneath their foreheads.</p>
                        <p>Your uniform is another outward symbol of your status. It is made of humble, tough fabric, similar to what you wore as an Initiate, but its hooded robe makes it more suited for travel and exposure to the elements.</p>

                        <p>As a Padawan, you reflect upon not only your Master but also upon the entire Jedi Order. </p>
                        <p>Remember to carry yourself with calm professionalism, to answer all questions directed your way, to be fair but firm, and to stay far, far away from cantinas and spice dens.</p>
