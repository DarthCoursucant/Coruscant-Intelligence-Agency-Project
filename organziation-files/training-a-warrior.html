                <h1>Training A Warrior</h1>

                <p>The means to produce the finest warriors and assassins in the galaxy are at our fingertips, and they have commanded the highest prices on the galactic market. Our abilities are paying off. If you have left our fold, know that your service sustains us and validates our traditions.</p>
                <p>You are an agent of the nightsisters, and more must follow in your path. If you do not have a current assignment, you should train others to achieve your rank. All Nightsisters and Nightbrothers have trained since they were young to use our weapons: the pike, the mace, the spear, the ax, and the chain-sickle. Those worthy to become warriors or assassins must be tested to prove their skill. In the arena of the Crucible, the candidates face three tests-the tests of fury, light, and elevation. Any who fails a test will be eliminated.</p>
                <p>In the Test of fury, the candidates are pitted against one another or against their instructor. Some may form alliances for advantage, whereas others may stand alone against all challengers. Either response is useful in determining a candidate s temperament for battle.</p>
                <p>When the moons are low and all light has been extinguished, the Test of Night may be held. The candidates fight much like they do in the Test of Fury, but without eyesight.</p>
                <p>Some candidates may exhibit preternatural senses or a gift for stealth. Some may even have the presence of mind to channel Ears of the Chiroptix.</p>
                <p>During the Test of Elevation, the Crucible's mouing pillars are activated.</p>
                <p>Combatants are left unsure of their footing, as if fighting on shifting sand. Those with cunning will use the stone blocks as cover for ambushes. Those with aggression will use the high ground to pounce upon their prey. The most skilled candidates will not only survive the Crucible, but will dominate the battles. These are the most fit for a future off world assignment.</p>
