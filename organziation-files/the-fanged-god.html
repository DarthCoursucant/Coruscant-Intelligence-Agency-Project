                <h1>The Fanged God</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container-one">
                <p>The Fanged God appears as a night-black gargoyle in the spirit realm. He governs virility and the hunt. He also communicates smells, sounds, and tastes. He is the counterpart to the Winged Goddess and is equally important to the governance of the spirit realm. As nightsisters, you draw from both pools and thus keep the universal energies in balance.</p>
                <p>The magic of the fanged God is so powerful that channeling it can burst minor blood vessels in our physical bodies, raising telltale bruises on the cheeks and around the eyes. These marks were once considered scars of shame by the passive witches who referred the Book of Law. Yet they are brands of honor. Our tradition of facial tattooing reclaims this history for ourselves and announces to the galaxy that we are night-sisters. And while our nightbrothers are kept separated, they are marked as our kin and our warriors by the tattooing on their chests and faces.</p>
                <p>It is the Fanged God who conjures up the Wild Munt each year, when the moons are at their brightest and the snows have vanished from the slopes of the Shattered Ridge. I have seen the dark figures with glowing pale eyes as they gallop through the forest. I have heard their hunt-calls as they carry those who cross in their path back to the abode of the ethereal riders.</p>
                <p>The Fanged God is close to you at all times. He seeps through the border separating the two realms and does not require as much effort to channel. Every time you fight or feast or bleed, you are communing with the Fanged God.</p>
                <p>As girls you learned to speak with our planets native rancors and to ride them.</p>
                <p>The realm beyond shadows contains a single r-spirit for each of the galaxy s animal species. And just as you did with rancors, so can you do with the ur-spirits. Once you acquire the tongue of a particular ur-spirit, you can understand any creature of that type. Once you can communicate with the creature, you can calm it. Once you can calm it, you can control it. The most skilled nightsisters who study this art hold the rank of beast warden.</p>
                <p>Because the fanged God governs the hunt, he is present during tracking, sacrifice, and the drinking of blood. He can sharpen your perceptions to set you on the path of the most elusive prey even when you are far from Dathomir It is he who gifts us with the blood trail, a technique in which you place a drop of your own blood on your target and use that link to track your quarry across the stars. It is a technique known only to the nightsisters.</p>
