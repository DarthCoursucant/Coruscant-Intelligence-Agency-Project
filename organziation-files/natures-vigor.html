                <h1>Nature's Vigor</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>

            <div id="text-note-container-one">
                <p>The echoes of the fanged God can be heard throughout the air of Dathomir, from the sound of the snuffling moogs hidden in their lairs to the screeches of the archixes circling their aeries atop the Singing Mountain. The ur-spinits of animals are red and raw, but the twin spirit of plants pulses with a deep green.</p>
                <p>You are an animal yourself and still a part of Lathomir s life web, even when you find yourself inside a hollow metal starship around a cold star. You can always tap into the power of the spirits. Fan the fires of your bestial nature, and you will share the abilities of the beasts themselves.</p>
                <p>Predators possess a degree of awareness that we do not. By invoking the ability known as the Sense of the Jeshet, you will distinguish scents carried on the wind from hundreds of meters away and will be able to see into blackness even when the moons have hid their faces. If you invoke the Ears of the Chiroptix, you will hear whispers and be able to paint pictures of hidden places from their sounds.</p>
                <p>Some beasts must be nimble to avoid predators as well as to catch their prey. By invoking the Speed of the Toocha, you will be imbued with short bursts of blindingly fast speed and energized leaps to cover remarkable distance. Both can be useful tor escape or surprise. Invoking the touch of the Kiin Dray applies a binding force to your hands and feet, enabling you to scramble up a cliff face or to hold a weapon in a grip no one can break.</p>
                <p>The whuffaâ€™s power of regeneration has a host of combat uses. The Revitalization of the Whuff can refresh the body or, if one's will is sufficient, allow the regrowth of a limb. The Scream of the Ssurian can bring forth the deep, thrumming vibrations of the great dragon's hunting call, as well as the earsplitting shriek of its territorial warning.</p>
                <p>When directed at an enemy, the wave of sound will pop eardrums and shatter teeth.</p>
                <p>Compared to the animal essences, the green spirits of the plants are quieter and more content, but they are not without uses. Invoking them will generate the calming aura of meditation or break down a poison once it has infected the bloodstream. With Surge of the Brier, you can reach into the spirit realm and grip the essence of a sessile plant. Pull and twist the plant's physical form into a shape of your choosing. By doing this you can wrap enemies in vines or impale them with thorns.</p>
                <p>Even weather has a spirit. Its formless expanse glows with the blue-black hue of the heavens before moonrise. The Aspect of the Storm will allow you to shape this inky fabric into the bright white threads of lightning strikes.</p>
                <p>Deeper summoning will bring forth winds that can carry you through the sky. The air may also carry you aloft within a green sphere of energy, just as foam rises from a churning waterfall. Within this bubble you are protected from enemies while hurling lightning on their heads.</p>
