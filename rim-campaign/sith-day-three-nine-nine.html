                <p>The Sith Emperor has ordered us to recapture Ord Radama. I will lead the attack. There are rumors that some blame me for the death of Lord Venemal and the defeat we suffered there.</p>
                <p>This campaign shall restore my honor and prove the fitness of the Sith Empire.</p>
                <p>I am leaving nothing to chance. Typical soldiers do not use the dark side, and Sith Inquisitors are too hands-off for my tastes. For this battle, I will command a regiment of Force-strong warriors.</p>
                <p>The methods and traditions of the warrior are my own.</p>
                <p>From my father's meditations on death to the lessons of my tutors in the Dromund Kaas academy, I was nurtured by the dark side and grew strong. Others dull their senses with spice and drink, but warriors know that combat is the only experience to be savored.</p>
                <p>Other Sith Lords keep their elite dark side warriors in reserve, far from the enemy, to preserve their strategic insights. What a waste! They have attained their rank because they have fought and won. To deny them the honor of combat is to call them useless. Not only is it an insult, it weakens the Sith Empire as a whole.</p>
                <p>I will lead the assault on Ord Radama's relocated capital city of New Raido. My warriors are experts in the art of wielding two lightsabers and are outfitted with combat armor newly manufactured on Balmorra. The armor is heavy, but warriors are capable of endless endurance. </p>
                <p>Droids, troopers, commandos, and more will follow bac after we breach the city's defenses. Imperial Intelligence reports that the Republic has done little to fortify Ord Radama, and the natives have struggled to survive following the destruction of Livien Magnus.</p>
                <p>Our victory will hardly qualify as a conflict, but it will be enough.</p>
                <p>From Ord Radama, I will be able to seek new targets of conquest for the improvement of the Sith Empire.</p>
