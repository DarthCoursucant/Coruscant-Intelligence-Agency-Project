                <p>We will lose Ord Radama if we are not resupplied. That fool Adraas is gone, slinking back to Dromund Kaas to curry favor with the Dark Council. Meanwhile, Lord Venemal and I are left here to carry on our work, defending the city from agitators. Our numbers steadily dwindle.</p>
                <p>The essential quality of the Force is conflict. Through conflict, the strong kill the weak and bring the living closer to perfection. The Sith Empire has served the Force by inciting conflict. But for true improvement to take place, I must at least give my soldiers a fighting chance against the enemies who seek to destroy them.</p>
                <p>The Ministry of Logistics is responsible for our resupply, but my influence with Minister Khamarr has never been strong.</p>
                <p>She is a favorite of the Dark Council and rewards the needs of Dromund Kaas above all others. I, instead, have sent my requests to War Minister Shareis but have received no answer.</p>
                <p>Politics sicken me. Begging for resources from a bureaucrat is not a fitting role for a Sith Lord. All such functionaries should be honored to do my bidding and should scramble to see it done. For we Sith Lords are elevated above the non-Force users who staff our galactic regime. But neither Minister Shareis nor his Grand Moffs can do anything for me if other Sith Lords have already placed claims on his resources.</p>
                <p>The glow lantern on the ration crate has dimmed to nearly nothing as I write these words.</p>
                <p>The rattling bursts of the cacophanizer shells have quieted into a far-off rumble. I think of you, Eleena. As ever, the rage within me ignites when I think of how you have been kept from me.</p>
                <p>All aliens are slaves under the Sith Empire. Every resource must be exploited when the cause is total victory. But you, Eleena, have proven yourself-as a servant and as a fighter, and perhaps as something more. When I have achieved all I envision, I will have any companion I wish. Not even the Emperor would dare command otherwise.</p>
