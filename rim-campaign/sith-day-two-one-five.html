                <p>Disaster. We have abandoned Ord Radama. Venemal is dead and so is the legion of troops under my command.</p>
                <p>My resupplies never arrived. No doubt Minister Shareis felt Lord Adraas, or some other dilettante, should be well armed for another needless inspection tour. Through his incompetence, the Empire is losing its hold on the systems we have only just secured.</p>
                <p>Imbeciles, all of them.</p>
                <p>I hear that even the Mandalorian Blockade is crumbling, because of the two smugglers allied with the Republic.</p>
                <p>If the Hydian Way is reopened, the trickle of Republic reinforcements that retook Ord Radama will become a flood.</p>
                <p>The Battle of Old Radama was not lost on the ground.</p>
                <p>Venemal and I could have held the capital city indefinitely, armed with only our lightsabers. But in orbit overhead, we had only the dreadnought Lindworm and two Harrower battle cruisers.</p>
                <p>In opposition, four Republic Hammerhead-class cruisers anc ten Thranta-class corvettes dropped from hyperspace. They broadsided the Lindworm with a turbolaser barrage before she could launch her starfighters.</p>
                <p>From the balcony of the palace in Livien Magnus, I saw the flashes of orbital combat as the comm erupted with static and anxious chatter. I boarded my shuttle, ordering Captain Karm to take me up to the Lindworm, where I could assume command.</p>
                <p>The captain performed with characteristic skill, evading the Republic's Aurek fighters and making a hard landing in the Lindworm's ventral bay. But by the time the turbolift got me to the bridge, I could see the battle was lost.</p>
                <p>One of our Harrowers gushed flames as it let loose a rain of escape pods. The other Harrower lay fatally stricken, its guts torn loose by a cluster of proton torpedoes. I could do nothing to halt its fall into Ord Radama's gravitational pull. Minutes later. it impacted at the center of Livien Magnus.</p>
                <p>At that instant, I felt Venemal and a hundred thousand other life-forms roar with pain and then fall silent.</p>
                <p>The strength of my scream buckled the bridge's transparisteel viewport and left the crew's ears bleeding.</p>
                <p>More gratifyingly, my rage overloaded the fuel slugs of an incoming wave of Aureks. The bright bursts of their deaths raised a smile.</p>
                <p>Nothing could be gained by remaining in the star system.</p>
                <p>I ordered the dazed navigator to maneuver the Lindworm behind the ion minefield and to make the jump into the heart of Sith Space.</p>
