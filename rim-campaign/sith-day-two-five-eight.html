                <p>We must now defend the heart of our own territory. I am enraged the Dark Council allowed the war to reach Ashas Ree, yet I must allow some measure of admiration for the way the Republic has outmaneuvered us.</p>
                <p>They made their first strike while Lord Angral's vessels were still gathered at Ziost. We arrived just in time to halt their advance on the central garrison. Do they think they can hold this world?</p>
                <p>Do they hope to fortify it as a staging point for a strike against Dromund Kaas? Or is this a way to preoccupy our forces yet again, while they capture some other objective?</p>
                <p>I write from a clearing at the garrison's outskirts, amid the encampments of the planet's doctrinists, who desire a return to the Empire's isolationism. They have often stood in opposition to our Emperor-but today, we are all Sith.</p>
                <p>I command a line of siege tanks positioned to hold off the Republic's armored floaters that regularly prod our defenses along the jungle border. Above my head, the energy shield protecting the garrison flares white with each impact of a mortar shell. Occasionally, a thundering turbolaser blast reaches us from the naval clash in orbit.</p>
                <p>I have learned that the Republic commander behind this bold move is Jedi Master Ven Zallow. Despite his allegiance to Jedi blasphemy, he at least appears to grasp the truth of improvement through combat.</p>
                <p>Master Zallow, and those like him, may yet realize their errors and join the Sith cause. Until then, I will do everything in my power to rid the galaxy of them. Ever since my vision at Korriban those many years ago, I have known that my destiny is to exterminate the Jedi and topple their obscene Temple.</p>
