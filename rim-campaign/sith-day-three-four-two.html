                <p>The operation on Serenno only partially succeeded. A subspace transmission from the ciphers announced that the infiltrator had struck. I ordered the fleet to make the leap.</p>
                <p>We surprised the Republic vessels and scattered them.</p>
                <p>We secured House Palerma's villa, which the Jedi had been using as a command post. But rage tore through me when I discovered the infiltrator's body lying in the banquet hall, cut in two by Zallow's lightsaber. And Zallow had escaped aboard one of the Republic cruisers!</p>
                <p>Although Serenno now belongs to the Empire, it does not accept us. Incredibly, the Houses of Teramo and Comprassi have hired mercenaries to evict us. I awoke last night to the sound of magnetic accelerator shells punching through the permacrete plaster of the villa's walls.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, I came to Serenno prepared. The Dark Council supplied me with a squad of elite assassins. I have never desired their path. My power comes from fury, honed by combat. I prefer to smell the fear in an enemy's sweat rather than manipulate him with spells from afar. But at that moment, I was glad to have the assassins under my command.</p>
                <p>From a parapet, I watched the assassins ring the villa and fan out in all directions. They lit up the moonless dark with blue fashes of lightning. Their commanders directed them toward the attackers, like battle neks pursuing a hunting quarry.</p>
                <p>The mercenaries abandoned their heavy weapons and fired back with antiquated pulse-wave pistols. A pathetic attempt with feeble weapons. Their screams soon ceased, and I securea a few more hours of sleep before sunrise.</p>
