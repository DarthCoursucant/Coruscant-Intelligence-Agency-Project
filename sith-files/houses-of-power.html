                    <p>Sith Purebloods are natural adepts at the dark side. This I must emphasize, for it is this trait that will make us far stronger in exile than we ever were when we held our former ranks. I have always been one to seek out rumors of esoteric worlds and their life bounty, and I do not know of another species like them.</p>
                    <p>The Sith have had a thousand generations to perfect the dark arts. The ziggurats of stacked stone and the mountainsides carved into stern faces are more than just tombs for vanished kings.</p>
                    <p>When you stand at the intersection of this mystic architecture, you feel a rush of wind and a shiver of electricity. The angles of these mausoleums focus the arcane energies of the Force.</p>
                    <p>On Korriban, which is a planet of nothing but tombs, the very dust appears to generate force energy. The Valley of Golg is lined with monuments that stood long before the Zhell marched across Coruscant. Shortly after our relocation to Ziost, I returned to Korriban with a small cadre of priests and a vast retinue of slaves to unseal the tombs. I could sense they were ripe for plunder.</p>
                    <p>Upon entering our first target, the Cloister of Bilious Torment, I noted that the passages bristled with dart shooters and were lined with columns that toppled at the slightest footstep. I lost two score slaves, but their corpses will scarcely seem out of place. Sealed inside the tombs along with the dead lords were the desert mummified corpses of their servants. Once we penetrated the outer passages, the inner sanctum held the sarcophagus of the great ruler, placed at the center of a power loci.</p>
