                        <p>If my plan had not worked and Kaan had not killed himself with the thought bomb, I would have been forced to kill him myself. The annihilation at Ruusan was a gift, wiping out all those who were not worthy. I, Darth Bane, and my apprentice, Darth Zannah, survived and returned the potency of the Sith to our hands, so the Rule of Two could be instituted.</p>
                        <p>It is no accident that I took the title of Darth when I gained a mastery of the dark side, nor is it an accident that Kaan and his followers rejected it. It is a title of power. It carries authority and is crowned by the judgment of history. It symbolizes transformation. </p>

                        <p>Some believe the Darth itself is derived from the ancient Rakatan term darr tah, meaning "triumph over death," or daritha, meaning "emperor." But the word's true meaning does not come from any language but from the proud histories and accomplishments of those who have borne the title:</p>
