                        <p>Alchemy is my science, yet I have found the Sith Purebloods possess a new understanding of how to manipulate the dark side. I sought the secrets of spellasting in my pilfered holocron, but its guardian was jcalous. Casting my net wider, I recovered scrolls submerged in the blood slurry of the Mongrel Altar. They were concealed behind a mural of King Adas at the Eternal Pyre, interred alongside the headless body of Wyrmuk the Undying, Reading one of these great scrolls invariably unleashed a curse.</p>
                        <p>I have found that the longer I must fight off horror, blindnes or liquefaction, the more valuable is the information the scroll contains.</p>

                        <p>It is not sufficient to simply use Force powers, as the Jedi teach.</p>
                        <p>Ritual gives spellcasting added power. Memorize the incantations, speak them with conviction, and weave the invisible lines of power through gesture. Through this, I have changed the world in ways my teachers never imagined.</p>
                        <p><b>Sutta Chwituskak, or Bolt of Hatred:</b> By focusing your rage on the ones who stand against you, you can conjure a spear of dark energy to pierce their flesh.</p>
                        <p><b>Osojinga, or Dark Side We6:</b> Wich quick and precise finger slashes, you can spin a tracery of Force tendrils to block a sword or bind a foe.</p>

                        <p><b>OÃ¢zoi Kyantuska, or Suppress Thought:</b> By fi addling your victim's brain and then supplanting the quieted thoughts with the sound of your own voice, you can control the will of another.</p>
                        <p><b>Divomutsigsa, or Summon Demon:</b> By concentrating on the air and energy around you, you can call forth a manifestation of the dark side. A dreambeast has no true form. Its shape is whatever its victim fears most. A smoke demon can travel as windblown miasma or coalesce into solid form when commanded to attack. It can vaporize the body of a victim by entering its nose or mouth, though it is vulnerable to Force-based counterattacks.</p>

                        <p><b>Isaiwinokka Hoyakut, or Reanimated Dead:</b> This complex spell animates both the freshly dead and the skeletons of the carrion fields, transforming them into an unstoppable legion impervious to pain and able to transmit a necromancy infection by biting. I would have taken pleasure in meeting with Dathka Graush, who died decades before our arrival. Though he is gone, it was he who melded alchemy and spellcasting to perfect necromancy.</p>
                        <p>Words have power. Proof is in the Sith scrolls I acquired. When read, they release malevolence as a safeguard against those who would unlock their secrets. Better to leave hundreds blinded with a binding curse than surrender power to a single fool.</p>

                        <p>The abilities described in the ancient Sith language are new and astonishing. It is clear that in all the cons since the Jedi left Tython, they have never divined the value of incantation. When a Sith sorcerer speaks, he gives voice to the thousand mages who went before him. If armed with the proper commands and trappings, the dark side can be bound, leashed, and led down any path of your choosing.</p>
                        <p>Sith spells that require vocalization are written in the Sith tongue, and consequently must be pronounced as such. Be aware that it is more than recitation. Your inflection must be both  precise and passionate. Speak with hesitation, and the spell may haunt you instead.</p>
