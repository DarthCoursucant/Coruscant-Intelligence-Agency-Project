                        <p>The war against the Jedi birthed great advances in personal combat on both sides.</p>
                        <p>Armorers constantly improved their wares, but lightsaber technology remained constant.</p>
                        <p>By the war's end, a fully armored Jedi Padawan could face a Sith Marauder and survive the first exchange. Donning armor requires understanding two things: how to kill an armored opponent and how to use armor to protect yourself from counterattack.</p>

                        <p>The first comes from combat training. The second requires an understanding of the materials that can withstand a lightsaber blow while still allowing some measure of mobility for the wearer.</p>
                        <p>If you are accustomed to unarmored sparring, it is best to begin with <b>armorweave.</b> This material incorporates a lightweight metallic mesh while maintaining the flexibility of cloth.</p>

                        <p>It can be arranged to form pieces of fabric armor, or it can be worn as a cloak. It will guard against acids and flame. It can diffuse the energy of blaster bolts, though not their kinetic impact.</p>
                        <p>A lightsaber's point can burn through armorweave, but it will allow you to shrug off glancing blows made with a blade's edge.</p>

                        <p>It is plate armor cast from Mandalorian iron.</p>
                        <p>Although it is nearly impervious to a lightsaber blade, it is extremely heavy and requires the wearer to rely on a Strong style, or djem so, combat stance.</p>
                        <p>Unique to the Sith is dark armor-plate armor that is infused with a dark side essence through Sith alchemy.</p>
                        <p>These suits, once rare, poured from the workshops of Sith armorers during the last war. Many became prizes for battlefield scavengers.</p>

                        <p>The shells of orbalisks are quite impervious to lightsabers and can make a fine coat of armor. I myself have tested this bizarre panoply.</p>
                        <p>These parasites breed in the tombs of Dxun. If placed on the skin, they latch on, feeding on Force energy and releasing adrenaline. Once attached, their bodies can almost never be removed.</p>
                        <p>The protection offered by armor can be augmented with a shield held in your off hand. A shield of polished beskar can also be used as a bashing weapon. Its edges can be honed to razor sharpness and can be used to slice or kill.</p>
