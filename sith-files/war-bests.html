                <h2>The holocron revealed much about the creation of warbeasts, but Ziost's breeding pens provided a more immediate education. What a delight to have landed amidst fellow twisters of life!</h2>
                <h2>Among the Kissai are the Ninushwodzakut, whose title translates as Knotters of Entrails." Through alchemy and manipulated breeding, they have birthed many hungry creatures to toil and kill for the Sith.</h2>

                        <p>The silooth are mutated from beetles. Long ago, the Sith scattered them across the world of Kalsunor. The click of their mandibles became a dire drumbeat. These tank-sized scavengers can still be found on the planet, melting its ruined cities with sprays of acid. The Sith keep swarms of them in reserve for another campaign.</p>

                        <p>During the same war that birthed the silooth, the Sith introduced the warbird and the war behemoth.</p>
                        <p>Mainstays among the Massassi infantry even today, the warbirds are used as mounted assault avians that can carry a rider into battle and rip apart enemy soldiers with their beaks. The gargantuan behemoths are used a little differently-as troop carriers or walking weapons platforms.</p>

                        <p>They have long been the royal companions of Sith Kings. They possess great tactical intelligence and can live for centuries without feeding. I would have died in the Tomb of Din Grrut had I not fed a Sith slave to the tuk'ata.</p>
