                    <h1>The Power Of Sith</h1>
                    <p>In that simple maxim is the entirety of Sith philosophy.</p>
                    <p>What Lord Kaan and my other, lesser predecessors could not understand is that such a fundamental truth is not evidence of insight on my part but, rather, stupidity on their part.</p>
                    <p>The Force is not fire. It cannot be passed from one user's lit torch to another's, and another's, until an entire hemisphere is illuminated with a blaze of a million lights. This is what Kaan foolishly believed, and all Sith Lords before him for the past thousand years. It is why the once mighty Sith fell apart long before the defeat at Ruusan. </p>
                    <p>When all carry a flame, no matter how dim and guttering it may be, they soon conclude they are the brightest stars, around which all others must orbit. Infighting follows, and Jedi victory becomes inevitable.</p>
                    <p>No, the Force is venom. If it is poured into many cups, it loses its potency until it becomes so diluted it is merely an irritant.</p>
                    <p>Yet pour those cups back into a single vessel and you will have the power to stop a Krayt dragon's heart.</p>
                    <p>This is the secret. This is the Rule of Two: </p>
                    <p><b>One Sith must contain all the power of the dark side.</b></p>
                    <p><b>One Master must decide how that power shall be used. </b></p>
                    <p><b>Sharing power is an act of weakness and a violation of the Sith Code.</b></p>
