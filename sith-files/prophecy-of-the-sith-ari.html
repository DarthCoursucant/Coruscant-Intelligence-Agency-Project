                        <p>I know the Jedi myth of Mortis, of a Chosen One who will destroy the dark side and bring balance to the Force. The Sith have their own prophecy. Since the time of King Adas, they have foretold the coming of a perfect being—the Sith'ari.</p>
                        <p>The abbatar around my neck translates the term as "overlord." Yet it is more accurate to consider the Sith'ari a god, as the Sith Purebloods believe. While some among the Kissai priests deem that the prophecy began and ended with Adas, many more await the Sith'aris return.</p>

                        <p>It has not escaped us that we could claim the Sith'ari made Cú and exert even more power over Sith Space. Yet such a move could backir among the superstitious. Not even Ajunta Pall is  so careless.</p>
                        <p>The prophecy of the Sithari has been passed through verbal tradition. It is too sacred to be inscribed on a scroll's parchment. From the Kissai, I have learned its essence: </p>

                        <p>Improvement through sacrifice and rebirth resonates among these people who prize breeding and alchemy.</p>
