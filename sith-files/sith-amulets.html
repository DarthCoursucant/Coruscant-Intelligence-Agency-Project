            <p>The melce weapons of the Sith are carried by the brute Massassi, but their amulets require more skill. Many among the Kissai priests wear these baubles around their necks to deepen their links to the dark side of the Force.</p>
            <p>Minor amulets can create protective shields, knit injured flesh, sharpen battle focus, or energize weakened muscles. However, great amulets are priceless and often unique. Users must first overcome the amulets seductive song. For if they can't, they will be forever lost to dark side insanity. I have acquired many of these prizes for myself, but I remain restless knowing that many more lie locked in the tombs of Korriban.</p>
            <p>Of the amulets I have encountered, these are the most powerful:</p>

                        <p>My experimentation with the Heart of Graush and my alchemic mastery of raising Sithspawn will culminate in the first Great Amulet to be worn by one of the Lords of the Sith. Its power will transform the feeble-minded into braying rakghouls, whose actions are the result of the wearer's desire. It will also preserve the wearer's spirit should he fall in combat. Though Karness will receive the first, I will complete more than one amulet. The second will go to Dreypa, so those two fools can battle other unceasingly. The third shall be far stronger than the others, and it shall be mine alone.</p>
