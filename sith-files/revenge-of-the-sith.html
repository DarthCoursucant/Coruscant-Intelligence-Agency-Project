                        <p>Under the Rule of Two, the Sith will concentrate power in one Master and one apprentice so that one day we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. Eventually, we will have revenge.</p>
                        <p>Galactic civilization is an empty term when that civilization lacks leadership. Given a clear vision and the means to enact it, a Sith regime could build great wonders in defiance of the natural laws of silence, stillness, and ruin. Kaan was a fool, but he was right in one thing:</p>
                        <p><b>The laws of the current Republic only abet these chaotic forces, and only the Sith way leads to mastery over entropy.</b></p>

                        <p>The Jedi path teaches harmony and peace. But if all we aspired to was harmony, then intelligent beings would still be scratching for food from rotted tree stumps. The dark side of the Force is both an enabler and a guide. To advance the cause of the Sith, you must fight those who would hold back progress. You, and those who succeed you, are building an arsenal of dark side potency. One day it will contain the power to destroy the Jedi and bring purpose to the Force.</p>
                        <p>Remember the Code of the Sith: There is no peace, only passion. n creating a new regime, the Sith will defeat the complacency f the Jedi. And what we create will be glorious!</p>
