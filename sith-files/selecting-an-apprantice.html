                        <p>Again, the Sith Order is a lineage. It must not end with you! I I will not allow my new Sith Order to expire because you were unworthy or too protective to bequeath your power.</p>
                        <p>Know this: Your apprentice will kill you. If this fact frightens you, then the Sith Order has already suffered a fatal infection.</p>
                        <p>Your existence in the Order is not needed. Your battle has already been lost.</p>
                        <p>A Sith apprentice must grow in strength and skill until he or she can surpass the Master.</p>

                        <p>Anything else is regression! Would you have the Sith become like the "kings" of Shawken whose dominion crumbled into ruin?</p>
                        <p>Or do you believe you will live forever? You are not wrong to covet that secret, for I have sought to prolong my own life. But in the extreme, this leads to narcissism and a lack of focus on the Rule of Two. To be a Sith Lord is to outthink your enemies and to plan for any eventuality. A proper apprentice will ensure that the Sith endure, no matter what fate may come upon your head.</p>
                        <p>Many Force-sensitive beings exist among the stars. Seek out those who have not yet been discovered or subjected to Jedi corruption. </p>

                        <p>Tell them only one will survive to become your apprentice.</p>
