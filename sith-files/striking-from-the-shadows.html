                        <p>The Sith of old brazenly and publicly announced their superiority. In this, they were correct.</p>
                        <p>They were mistaken, though, if they thought no legion of enemies would rise up against them.</p>
                        <p>The Sith have always been smeared as wicked, evil beings, no different from the cacodemons of children's tales who lurk in dark places with dripping fangs. Because submission to such horror is unthinkable, many believe they must fight or face extermination.</p>
                        <p>The Jedi are shameless in spreading this alarmist propaganda.</p>

                        <p>Under the Rule of Two, the Sith will operate in secrecy â€”feeding the belief that the Sith are a thing of the past, forgotten in their graves on Ruusan. We must not make our presence known.</p>
                        <p>The dark side of the Force is finally concentrated. It gives the two beings unlimited power, but the Sith cannot afford the loss of either of you! Do not make yourselves targets. Even a Sith Lord can be felled by a thousand enemies.</p>
                        <p>If there exists a single being who believes in the continued existence of the Sith, kill him. If a group learns the secret, you'must resort to subterfuge and misdirection. At one point, the Jedi believed they had evidence of my own survival after Ruusan. </p>

                        <p>My apprentice and I concocted a ruse in which she drove her brother insane and made him appear to be the terrible "Sith Lord." This satisfied the Jedi need to assign blame, and they moved on.</p>
                        <p>The Sith Order is now a lineage. Given your skills, you should find it a simple matter to amass wealth, and thus with each succession the resources of the Sith will increase. Do not build palaces, for they will draw attention. Use your money to hire spies, scholars, assassins, trainers, guards, and thieves. All will prove useful, and the shine of credits will distract them from your true nature.</p>
