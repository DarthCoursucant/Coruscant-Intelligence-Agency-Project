                        <p>None of these creatures arises from nature. They are bred for their extreme forms. Breeding has limits, however. It takes genera-tions, whereas alchemy is immediate-and forever.</p>
                        <p>Through alchemy, one uses the Force to effect change on the physical.</p>
                        <p>I was the greatest of the master summoners who fought in the Hundred-Year Darkness. My inspirations came to me in rumors and dreams, and only now, in the minaret of Ziost, do I realize it was the call of the Sith all along. </p>

                        <p>Sith alchemy is applied to both the living and the nonliving.</p>
                        <p>Each is a distinct discipline of study, with the latter being better suited for new apprentices.</p>
                        <p>Alchemy on the nonliving is far simpler because there are no living cells to resist you. This science is used to create amulets and enhance weapons. Any object touched with alchemical science will become Force-sensitive itself, forever retaining a mirror imprint of its forger.</p>
