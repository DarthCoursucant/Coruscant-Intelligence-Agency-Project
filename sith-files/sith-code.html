                        <p>The Sith Purebloods require no mantra to remind them how to live. They simply take what they can, kill what they don't need, and use everything to its fullest. They are ruled by the fittest and are a model of what the dark side can achieve.</p>

                        <p>There is knowledge to be gained from their example. If we were to create a Sith Code, it must point to the failings of Jedi beliefs while laying bare a path to mastery of the Force. It is plain that fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hatred leads to power, and power leads to victory. Rage channeled through anger is unstoppable.</p>
                        <p>The common edition of the Codex of Master Simikarty translates the Jedi Code thusly:</p>

                        <p>This Code confines its adherents. Peace, serenity, and harmony are restatements of the same thing- the passive acceptance of limitations. The Jedi encourage this.</p>
                        <p>But passion will always defeat peace. As we build our Empire here on Ziost, our successors will hold true to the Sith Code:</p>
