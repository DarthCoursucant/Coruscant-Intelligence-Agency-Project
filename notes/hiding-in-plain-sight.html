                <h1>Hiding In Plain Sight</h1>
                <h2>By Darth Sidious</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="text-note-container">
                <p>The galaxy is free of Jedi, and the citizens rejoice. Therefore it would be foolish to replace their regime with an identical system led by the Sith, at least publicly.</p>
                <p>The weak do not understand the Force. They venerate those who appear to be ordinary people like themselves.</p>
                <p>They cheered at the news that a resolute old man had survived a Jedi assassination attempt. In Palpatine, an ordinary Senator from Naboo, they see a model of human achievement.</p>
                <p>My apprentice and other agents of my will are fearsome embodiments of the dark side. Mere rumors of their presence are enough to frighten citizens into obedience. But those same citizens must not know that a Sith Lord has constructed the Galactic Empire until it is too late.</p>
                <p>But that hidden truth in no way diminishes my triumph.</p>
                <p>The Sith have long operated from the shadows, and the thousand-year wait of Darth Bane is over. The Sith have exacted their revenge. The galaxy praises the Empire, and the feeble-minded are not worthy of understanding its true origins.</p>
                <p>Like Darth Bane and my Master before me, I have honed the tools of deception.</p>
                <p>Darth Bane kept a low pro-file, but it was Darth Plagueis who, as the public face of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, shaped the economies of entire regions.</p>
                <p>In truth, everyone wears a mask. When speaking to others, a false persona can charm, seduce, or frighten.</p>
                <p>A Sith knows that all interactions are masked. It is no, great difficulty to don multiple masks when the situation demands it.</p>
                <p>All beings want to make sense of their reality, but none of them wish to think too deeply. They gravitate toward words that confirm their existing suspicions.</p>
                <p>In my decades as Ambassador, Senator, and Supreme Chancellor, I did not once encounter an exception to this rule. It was true whether I was reminding the Senate of the need for war powers or sitting across from Master Yoda and convincing him to send more Jedi Knights into harm's way. None suspected the duplicity of my identity.</p>
                <p>In fact, so convinced were the Jedi of their superior insight that they were the easiest to deceive.</p>
