                <h1>The History Of Nightsisters</h1>
                <h2>By Mother Talzin</h2>

                <p>How do we know our home world is unique among all the planets of the cosmos? | have a shaman's eyes, and I haue seen the proof. I have watched the spirits travel from one realm to another by means of a smoky tether that is anchored in our forests. If you study the histories of the outsiders, you will find only validation of my words.</p>
                <p>Throughout recorded time, great civilizations haue always been drawn to Dathomir:</p>
                <p>The packs of rhoa kwi, which hunt in the scrub fringe of the tar pits, are the primitive descendants of intelligent beings called the Kwa. They once held the favor of the spirits. The Kwa built Infinity Gates to travel to other stars, but their machines created unnatural voids and wounded Dathomi:</p>
                <p><b>Angry, the spirits summoned the Rakata</b></p>
                <p>Empire to demolish the Kwa. The spirits forced the Kwa back to their animal state so they might never again work technology.</p>
                <p>Over the millennia, the spirits called many other groups to Dathomir for purposes of their own. The Paecians came, made their homes here, and had many children. So, too, did the Sith. They recognized the raw power of Dathomir but could not perceive its true shape.</p>
                <p>Many years after the Sith abandoned their Dathomir academies, the Jedi exiled one of their own to this world. You know her as Allya, mother of all witches. Allya held the favor of the spirits, and her daughters became the first crafters of spirit-willed magicks.</p>
                <p>Centuries later, the Jedi returned. Their great training ship, the Chuâ€™unthor, was called to our shores, and the Jedi who came to reclaim it could not match our strength.</p>
                <p>Even their Master Yoda, the strongest of all the Jedi, abandoned the prize and fled.</p>
                <p>Few visitors have come to Dathomir since then. But the nightsisters spread throughout the galaxy after I unified the clans following the defeat of Mother Zalem.</p>
                <p>By performing missions and services for others, we are making the galaxy aware of our ways and enforcing the will of the spirits.</p>
